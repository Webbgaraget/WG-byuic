# WG byuic bash compressor

This is a fork of the [byuic bash compressor](http://wiki.brilaps.com/wikka.php?wakka=byuic).

## Changes

The following changes have been made

### Statistics

Statistics for each compressed file is printed during compression. This is done to satisfy the geeks out there :)

### .min.* ending

There's a new flag, `-m`, which can be used in order to create new files, ending with `.min.js` and `.min.css` respectively. If not used, the original files will be overwritten.ls

## Download

The script is available in the `src` folder.
